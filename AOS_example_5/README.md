## Library used and taken from?

Library taken from the AOS - Animate on scroll library by michalsnik http://michalsnik.github.io/aos/

## What the library does? 

- Small library to animate elements on your page as you scroll. 
- It is a CSS3 driven scroll animation library.
- Allows to animate elements on the website as you scroll down, and up.
- If you scroll back to top, elements will animate to it's previous state and are ready to animate again if you scroll down.

## Why the project is useful? 

- This library is useful as it allows websites to incorporate animations. For instance, displaying a menu of a restaurant and adding animated elements as you scroll through the menu, an interactive recipe, or some sort of "story-telling" website. The animations make the website appear less static and more engaging.

## What is the example 5 exploring?

- Example 5 uses the demo of the original AOS library http://michalsnik.github.io/aos/ 
- It explores how content can pop up while a static background is visible and how the animated content popping up using different animations can enhance engagement and interest from viewers.
- Taking the original demo with simply styled divs with text animating in on scroll, I incorporated graphics and more diverse animations to make the website come to life. This example is different from the other one I created (interactive banana recipe) as it plays with an on-click event listener. However, the library does not respond to clicks, only scrolls, so I managed to cheat the system to make it appear like the animations are triggered by click by adding an event listener that scrolls down 800px on every click that shows the next row of graphics.

## To use this code or improve upon it

Simple download this code and its necessary packages, and load it on live server to see it live on the server.

## Future improvements?

- This isn't ever going to be a functional website, just something I thought would be fun to do. It's a Fruit bowl, nothing else. It's fun, and cute. Maybe the on-click event listener could be useful if someone else wants to animate objects on click instead of on scroll.

## Who was responsible?

- For example 5 was Kornelia Papp responsible.
