## Why the project is useful? 

- This library is useful as it allows websites to incorporate animations. For instance, displaying a menu of a restaurant and adding animated elements as you scroll through the menu, an interactive recipe, or some sort of "story-telling" website. The animations make the website appear less static and more engaging. 

---

## What is the example 5 exploring?

- Example 5 uses the demo of the original AOS library http://michalsnik.github.io/aos/ 
- It explores how content can pop up while a static background is visible and how the animated content popping up using different animations can enhance engagement and interest from viewers.
- Taking the original demo with simply styled divs with text animating in on scroll, I incorporated graphics and more diverse animations to make the website come to life. This example is different from the other one I created (interactive banana recipe) as it plays with an on-click event listener. However, the library does not respond to clicks, only scrolls, so I managed to cheat the system to make it appear like the animations are triggered by click by adding an event listener that scrolls down 800px on every click that shows the next row of graphics. 

---

## Future improvements?

- This isn't ever going to be a functional website, just something I thought would be fun to do. It's a Fruit bowl, nothing else. It's fun, and cute. Maybe the on-click event listener could be useful if someone else wants to animate objects on click instead of on scroll.
