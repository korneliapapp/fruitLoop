## Library used and taken from?

The Library used is the AOS - Animate on scroll library by michalsnik http://michalsnik.github.io/aos/

## What the library does? 

- Small library to animate elements on your page as you scroll. 
- It is a CSS3 driven scroll animation library.
- AOS allows to animate elements on the website as you scroll down, and up.
- If you scroll back to top, elements will animate to it's previous state and are ready to animate again if you scroll down.

---

## Why the library is useful? 

- This library is useful as it allows websites to incorporate scrolling animations. For instance, having an interactive recipe that displays steps in a more fun and animated way instead of the usual boring, static, text based recipes that somehow gets people lost all the time while reading. Animations in general contribute to making websites more lively and less dull.

## What is the example 3 exploring?

- Example 3 uses the demo of the original AOS library http://michalsnik.github.io/aos/ as well as custom animations from this CodePen example that explores the same library https://codepen.io/michalsnik/pen/WxvNvE
- It explores how content can pop up while a static background is visible and how the animated content popping up using different animations can enhance engagement and interest from viewers.
- Taking the original demo with simply styled divs with text animating in on scroll, I incorporated graphics and more diverse animations to make the website come to life. Also tested how this function can be used in a real-life scenario useful for people, such as an interactive recipe.

## Future improvements?

- If this is to ever be used professionally or for a purpose, perhaps adding modals to the items (ingredients) showing up and animating those with the same library as well. The modals would include text that narrates the steps for cooking for thoroughly than the graphics if the users would ever need them.
