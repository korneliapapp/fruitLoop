Made by Josefine Lagerstedt

## What does this example do?
- Example 1 uses the following animation example from code pen: (http://michalsnik.github.io/aos/)
- It explores scroll speed and scroll duration when scrolling through the website. The speed code is from another code pen example: (https://codepen.io/JTParrett/pen/BkDie). The speed duration is from the AOS library.
