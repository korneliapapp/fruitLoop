## Why the project is useful? 

- This library is useful as it allows websites to incorporate animations. For instance, displaying a menu of a restaurant and adding animated elements as you scroll through the menu, makes the website less static and more interesting to look at.

## What is the example 4 exploring?

- Example 4 uses the following animation example from code pen: (http://codepen.io/michalsnik/pen/WxvNvE)
- It explore how content could be shown on the websites through different animations such as: scrolling down while the background of an element changes from red to green to highlight a change.
- In this example instead of the background changing from red to green, we included a picture to appear with the product as you scroll down to indicate properties of the product such as vegan product.
